# Mobilitchi

## Presentation

This site provides the passage schedules of RATP transports.
Mobilitchi sends the transit times of the various RATP transports by email or SMS at the configured time directly to the personal space via "add a schedule".
On this page, many options are available to you such as the recurrence, the sending method (mail, sms ..) and see the stations served by a transport. This site uses many technologies, in particular Flask (python) and JS libraries.
By using the RATP API, this site provides reliable and secure data.
